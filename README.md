# Sentimental Analysis
Sentiment analysis is an analytical technique that determines the emotional meaning of communications by combining statistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. Customer messages, contact centre encounters, online reviews, social media posts, and other information are all evaluated using sentiment analysis. The basic level of sentiment analysis involves either statistics or machine learning based on supervised or semi-supervised learning algorithms. By training machine learning tools with examples of emotions in text, machines automatically learn how to detect sentiment without human input. The machine learning allows computers to learn new tasks without being expressly programmed to perform them. Sentiment analysis models can be trained to read beyond mere definitions, to understand things like, context, sarcasm, and misapplied words.

Word clouds are an effective means of communication, as they are simple to comprehend. In a word cloud, the most frequently used keywords stand out more, and have an impact. The word cloud package is used in R to plot a word cloud. Dashboards are frequently an excellent way to share the results of analyses with others. Presenting word cloud in RShiny dashboards provides an easier way to interpret the most commonly used words in review, and generate the overall sentiment from the words. The “shinydashbaord” package is used to generate the RShiny dashboard
